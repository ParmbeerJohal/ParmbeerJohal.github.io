          <h1>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>As a UVic student preparing to graduate in the summer with a BSC in Computer Science, I'm ready to tackle the next
			step in my life which is joining tech workforce.
		  </p>

          <p>I have fun with the front end development of projects, but I'm not afraid to tackle the nitty-gritty backend development.
			My experience working in HTML, CSS, and Javascript gives me an eye capturing view on how users would want to see my work.
			Programming languages that I've been accustomed to include Java, C, Python, along with working with relational databases
			like PostgreSQL. My favourite areas of work are data mining and scaling distributed systems.</p>
		
		  <p>When i'm not sitting in front of the computer, I like to spend my time staying active with soccer and going to the gym. 
		    I'm also a big fan of music, which is big reason why I joined the computer science program in the first place. Music has 
			led me to a fun working industry and another passion!</p>
